# To-dos-list
This project is to upgrade my skills of HTML, CSS and especially JAVA SCRIPT.
In this project, it's all about the java script logics.
Firstly create the html page. 
The add little css to that page.
Then its all about the java script, how to add the item in the list and with the help of the delete button it should get deleted.

//But here in my project there is bug if you find that then do let comment.
